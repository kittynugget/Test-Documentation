1.5 How to Save A File 
=====
**From the Menu Bar in the top left corner of Rezonator click on the option File to make a dropdown appear. The Save option will save the current Rez File, and all of the changes that have been since last saving or opening. This option will overwrite the Rez Fileâ€™s current location**.

The Save As option functions identically to the Save button, except that the Save As button does not overwrite the current Rez File. This option will have the user choose a file location and a file name.
