### What is Word Editing?

**Word Editing** allows you to modify the words or tokens on the main screen, allowing for more annotation options.

Use cases of Word Editing include splitting compound words to annotate the pieces separately, and inserting placeholder or implicit words like the Zero morpheme.

### How to Access the Word Edit Dropdown

To begin Word Editing, **Right Mouse Click** on a new word/token in the Main Screen. This will open a dropdown menu containing the options **Split Word**,**New Word**, **Replace Word**, and **Restore Word**. These options are only shown if you are right-clicking on a new word. If it is not a new word, there are 5 options in the dropdown, "Split Word, New Word, Delete Link, Replace Word, and Restore Word. Currently on Mac, this dropdown menu is not viewable.

The option **Delete New Word** will be in the same drop down if you have **Right Mouse Clicked** on a new word

**Note**: When the selected word is in a Chain, this dropdown will have an additional option called **Delete Link**. This does not pertain to Word Editing.

### Functionality of the Word Edit Dropdown

The Split Word option allows you to split an existing word into 2 parts. Selecting this option will make a pop-up appear:

By inputting the two words in the described format, and **Left Mouse Clicking** the “OK” button, you will now have two independent words.

**Note**: In the Split Word Pop-up Window is the Split Word Toggle Button. When this is off, the window will switch to the Replace Word Window, allowing you to instead replace the selected word.

The New Word option allows you to insert a new word into the discourse. Selecting this option will activate another dropdown with the options \<0>, \<ZERO>, \<PRO>, and **Custom**.

\<0>, \<ZERO>, and \<PRO>, are all default new words. Selecting one of these defaults will open the New Word Pop-up Window, with the text input filled in with the selected word. Selecting the Custom option will open this window as well, with the text input blank.

With the new word typed in the text input box, clicking the “OK” button will insert the New Word before the selected word. Toggling the **Insert Before** button will have the New Word inserted after the selected word.

The Delete New Word option will delete the selected word, **only if it is a New Word**.
