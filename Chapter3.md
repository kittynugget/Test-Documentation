Rezonator features three different working modes that are designed to perform specific tasks. The modes can be accessed through the box on the right upper corner of the screen.

## 3.1 Unit Mode
**Unit Mode** is the default **Mode** of Rezonator, which limits the user’s ability to annotate the data, allowing for safe exploration of the data within the program. Unit Mode also features the **Line List** within the **List Window**. The functionalities of the Unit Mode are described below.

### 3.1.1	Activating Unit Mode

Unit Mode will be active by default when Rezonator is first opened, and this can be seen by the highlighted **Unit Mode Button** in the **Tool Pane**:

When not in Unit Mode, it can be activated by a **Mouse Click** on the Unit Mode Button.

### 3.1.2	Functionality of Unit Mode

While in Unit Mode, the user is able to navigate through the dialog in multiple ways. The other feature of Unit Mode is its connection to the **Line List**.

## 3.2 Trail Mode

**Trail Mode** is one of the two **Annotation Modes** of Rezonator, the other being **Rez Mode**. The main purpose of Trail Mode is to allow the user to “track” references of subjects across the discourse, through the use of **Trail Chains**.

### 3.2.1	 Activating Trail Mode

Trail Mode can be activated by a **Mouse Click** on the **Trail Tool Pane Button**:

![image109](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34769184/130829763-695573f1-afb7-4427-a35e-0d003986b431.png)

When Trail Mode is active, the Trail Tool Pane Button will be highlighted like so (see image above)

Alternatively, Trail Mode can be activated by pressing the “T” Key on your keyboard. Another way to activate Trail Mode is by selecting the Trail Tab within the **List Window**.

![image61](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34769184/130829926-57359967-1191-4069-b484-28bae5bc45f9.png)
  
### 3.2.2	Functionality of Trail Mode

The most important feature of Trail Mode is the creation of Trail Chains. A Trail Chain is a sequential set of words connected by **Links**. A Trail Chain looks like this:

![image2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34769184/130830151-b2d6bbea-4160-442b-a37e-ab51803fc7dc.png)

You can begin a Trail Chain by clicking on a **Word** in the discourse, creating the first Link in the chain

![image90](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34769184/130830255-697882ba-cd22-4a06-b81d-4d8ed3fbae26.png)

Press **enter** and a Trail Chain will be created, and it will be automatically **Focused**. When a chain is focused, Left Mouse Clicking on other words in the discourse will add those words to the focused chain.

![image133](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34769184/130830408-9dd40716-80c0-44cc-af82-d7607268a753.png)

If you want to no longer add words to a chain or start a new chain, you will need to **Unfocus** the currently focused chain. This is done multiple ways:
  * Left Mouse Clicking on the **Empty Space** in the Discourse.
  * Pressing the **Escape** key on your keyboard.

In order to **Refocus** a previous chain, you must Left Mouse Click on a word already within the chain. Also, you are able to **Merge Chains** together, combining one chain with another. This is done by Focusing one chain you want combined, then CTRL + Left Mouse Clicking (Command + Left Mouse Clicking on mac) on a word within the non-focused chain you want combined. A **Warning Window** will appear asking you to confirm the Merge. If you press “Yes”, the second Trail Chain will be merged into the First Trail Chain.

![image129](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34769184/130831169-9a580ddf-d02a-49cc-8770-74cd21267b2d.png)

To **Delete** a Link  within a Trail Chain, **Right Mouse Click** on the word you want removed from the chain. A **Dropdown Menu** will appear, with one option being “Delete Link”. Clicking this option will remove the selected word from the Trail Chain.

![image57](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34769184/130831340-9f76b5df-dd47-4e74-9f9c-05b21899a5cc.png)

Alternatively, you can Left Mouse Click on the word you want to remove from the Trail Chain, then press the **Delete Key** on your keyboard.

### 3.2.3	Functionality of Unit Mode

When in **Trail Mode**, the **Trail Chain List** can be found in the top 1/3rd of the window.

![image96](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34769184/130831450-5881dfc8-15af-4684-86ef-91d4662730f4.png)

There are 2 buttons on the lines in **Trail Mode**: **Filter Chains Button** & **Visibility Button**. The Filter Chains Button (filter cone), when activated by a Left Mouse Click, will add all active Trail Chains to the list of chains shown on the **Filter Screen**.

![image97](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34769184/130831607-4fb0f866-9320-42f8-b7e9-2e7fbe4e5528.png)![image23](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34769184/130834345-22bd4f32-9438-431b-a5ea-f260b5a676ff.png)

The Visibility Button (eyeball), when activated by a Left Mouse Click, will toggle the visibility of all Trail Chains on the main screen.

![image84](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34769184/130831676-6f8ad1e6-7757-4c43-a316-c14c60083feb.png)![image3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34769184/130834391-935efef3-44c4-498f-afd1-24894203dec8.png)

  - **Recolor** lets you choose a new color for the selected Trail Chain.
  - **Delete** will delete all of the links of the selected Trail Chain, eliminating the whole chain.
 
## 3.3 Rez Mode

**Rez Mode** is one of the two **Annotation Modes** of Rezonator, the other being Trail Mode. The main purpose of Rez Mode is to allow the user to visualize **Resonance**, through the use of **Rez Chains**.

### 3.3.1	 Activating Rez Mode

Rez Mode can be activated by a **Mouse Click** on the **Rez Tool Pane Button**:

![image17](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34769184/130874389-4851aed4-d3aa-4cce-80bb-c85a430a3900.png)

When Rez Mode is active, the Rez Tool Pane Button will be highlighted like so (see image above)

Alternatively, Rez Mode can be activated by pressing the **“R” Key** on your keyboard
  
### 3.3.2	Functionality of Rez Mode

The most important feature of Rez Mode is the creation of Rez Chains. A Rez Chain is a sequential set of words connected by **Links**. A Rez Chain looks like this:

![image99](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34769184/130874479-f342bfbf-5d45-4a56-a951-b6c8e8470194.png)

Note: Links within a Rez Chain will vertically **align**, if possible.

You can begin a Rez Chain by Left Mouse Clicking on a **Word** in the discourse, creating the first Link in the chain

![image132](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34769184/130874539-6cea5547-5094-4645-96e0-4236d29a8db6.png)

Once a Rez Chain is created, it will be automatically **Focused**. When a chain is focused, **Left Mouse Clicking** on other words in the discourse will add those words to the focused chain.

![image116](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34769184/130874600-2902c0bd-32e0-4699-858b-2ff2edb6ae74.png)

If you want to no longer add words to a chain or start a new chain, you will need to **Unfocus** the currently focused chain. This is done multiple ways:
  * Left Mouse Clicking on the **Empty Space** in the Discourse.
  * Pressing the **Escape** key on your keyboard.

In order to **Refocus** a previous chain, you must Left Mouse Click on a word already within the chain.  Also, you are able to **Merge Chains** together, combining one chain with another. This is done by Focusing one chain you want combined, then CTRL + Left Mouse (or Command + Left Mouse on Mac) Clicking on a word within the non-focused chain you want combined. A **Warning Window** will appear asking you to confirm the Merge. If you press “Yes”, the second Rez Chain will be merged into the First Rez Chain

![image123](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34769184/130874743-d5bf44fb-07e8-4e8e-a2b9-2b131f8cede6.png)

To **Delete a Link** within a Rez Chain, **Right Mouse Click** (Or CTRL + Left Mouse on Mac)  on the word you want removed from the chain. A **Drop Down Menu** will appear, with one option being “Delete Link”. Clicking this option will remove the selected word from the Rez Chain

![image108](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34769184/130874808-2d19eedf-cbc8-4980-ad30-448a6a9e49a8.png)

Alternatively, you can Left Mouse Click on the word you want to remove from the Rez Chain, then press the **Delete Key** on your keyboard.

As noted above, Rez Chains will automatically Align when possible. This is meant to aid in the visualization of resonance between speakers. However, there are scenarios in which alignment of chains is algorithmically impossible, such as the example below. Please note that in these cases, the Rez Chains will **not** align.

![image94](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34769184/130874872-01047324-8444-4335-8b2e-8f96a2987d7b.png)

### 3.3.3	Functionality of the Rez Chain List

**Rez Chain List** allows users to visualize the active Rez Chains and their contents.
There are 2 buttons on the lines in **Rez Mode: Filter Chains Button** & **Visibility Button**. The Filter Chains Button (filter cone), when activated by a Left Mouse Click, will add all active Rez Chains to the list of chains shown on the **Filter Screen**.

![image29](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34769184/130875009-3403fbd4-3bdc-46fe-9d8a-ce35017f2e95.png)
