2.3 Rez Mode
=====
**Rez Mode** is one of the two **Annotation Modes** of Rezonator, the other being Trail Mode. The main purpose of Rez Mode is to allow the user to visualize **Resonance**, through the use of **Rez Chains**.

### 2.3.1	 Activating Rez Mode

Rez Mode can be activated by a **Mouse Click** on the **Rez Tool Pane Button**:

When Rez Mode is active, the Rez Tool Pane Button will be highlighted like so (see image above)

Alternatively, Rez Mode can be activated by pressing the **“R” Key** on your keyboard
  
### 2.3.2	Functionality of Rez Mode

The most important feature of Rez Mode is the creation of Rez Chains. A Rez Chain is a sequential set of words connected by **Links**. A Rez Chain looks like this:

![image99](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34769184/130874479-f342bfbf-5d45-4a56-a951-b6c8e8470194.png)

Note: Links within a Rez Chain will vertically **align**, if possible.

You can begin a Rez Chain by Left Mouse Clicking on a **Word** in the discourse, creating the first Link in the chain

![image132](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34769184/130874539-6cea5547-5094-4645-96e0-4236d29a8db6.png)

Once a Rez Chain is created, it will be automatically **Focused**. When a chain is focused, **Left Mouse Clicking** on other words in the discourse will add those words to the focused chain.

![image116](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34769184/130874600-2902c0bd-32e0-4699-858b-2ff2edb6ae74.png)

If you want to no longer add words to a chain or start a new chain, you will need to **Unfocus** the currently focused chain. This is done multiple ways:
  * Left Mouse Clicking on the **Empty Space** in the Discourse.
  * Pressing the **Escape** key on your keyboard.

In order to **Refocus** a previous chain, you must Left Mouse Click on a word already within the chain.  Also, you are able to **Merge Chains** together, combining one chain with another. This is done by Focusing one chain you want combined, then CTRL + Left Mouse (or Command + Left Mouse on Mac) Clicking on a word within the non-focused chain you want combined. A **Warning Window** will appear asking you to confirm the Merge. If you press “Yes”, the second Rez Chain will be merged into the First Rez Chain

To **Delete a Link** within a Rez Chain, **Right Mouse Click** (Or CTRL + Left Mouse on Mac)  on the word you want removed from the chain. A **Drop Down Menu** will appear, with one option being “Delete Link”. Clicking this option will remove the selected word from the Rez Chain

![image108](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34769184/130874808-2d19eedf-cbc8-4980-ad30-448a6a9e49a8.png)

Alternatively, you can Left Mouse Click on the word you want to remove from the Rez Chain, then press the **Delete Key** on your keyboard.

As noted above, Rez Chains will automatically Align when possible. This is meant to aid in the visualization of resonance between speakers. However, there are scenarios in which alignment of chains is algorithmically impossible, such as the example below. Please note that in these cases, the Rez Chains will **not** align.

### 2.3.3	Functionality of the Rez Chain List

**Rez Chain List** allows users to visualize the active Rez Chains and their contents.
There are 2 buttons on the lines in **Rez Mode: Filter Chains Button** & **Visibility Button**. The Filter Chains Button (filter cone), when activated by a Left Mouse Click, will add all active Rez Chains to the list of chains shown on the **Filter Screen**.

![image29](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34769184/130875009-3403fbd4-3bdc-46fe-9d8a-ce35017f2e95.png)

![image31](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34769184/130875015-022786a7-3b41-4027-9791-524e3b1b52a1.png)

The Visibility Button (eyeball), when activated by a Left Mouse Click, will toggle the visibility of all Rez Chains on the main screen.

![image74](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34769184/130875067-eea3890f-99ad-4409-a8b8-3a43b7c55687.png)

![image42](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34769184/130875071-d2c94eb1-84d8-498d-a03d-97c497d956d2.png)

While in Rez Mode, the **List Window** will display a list of all the Rez Chains you have created, as shown here:

![image27](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34769184/130875106-3deb73e7-a2e1-437b-bf78-c9a3922a9746.png)

Another way to Focus a Rez Chain is with a Left Mouse Click on the chain’s row within the Rez Chain List

![image50](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34769184/130875131-c746de2f-7d18-4274-a295-f7e66c7e9365.png)

With a Rez Chain focused, the **Contents Window** will display the contents of the focused Rez Chain

![image43](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34769184/130875181-987922b0-bf57-4fe8-9a06-ce0383be20c7.png)

The Contents Window displays the individual Words within a Rez Chain, showing their **UID**, **Place**, and **Text**.

On the left side of the Rez Chain’s name is the Pick Toggle Button. The **Pick Toggle Button** will add that Rez Chain to the list of chains shown on the Filter Screen.

![image11](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34769184/130875311-b5fb8d47-d7a2-4bf0-ac3a-c7549aa5bf7f.png)

More options for Rez Chains can be accessed with a **Right Mouse Click** on a chain’s row (CTRL Click on Mac)

![image19](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34769184/130875359-955ef27b-5923-4c1f-8862-811f093706f1.png)

- **Rename** lets you input a string to name the selected Rez Chain.
- **Recolor** lets you choose a new color for the selected Rez Chain.
- **Delete** will delete all of the links of the selected Rez Chain, eliminating the whole chain.
