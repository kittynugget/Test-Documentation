### What is the Filter Screen?

The **Filter Screen** is a modified version of the Main Screen, showing only Chains that have been **Picked** for the Filter. Rez Chains, Trail Chains, and Stack Chains can all be Picked and displayed in the Filter Screen.  

Hereâ€™s an example of a single Chain in the Filter Screen:

### Activating the Filter Screen

In order for the Filter Screen to be activated, at least one Chain must be Picked for the Filter. An example of a picked Chain is shown below:

### Functionality of the Filter Screen

The Filter Screen allows you to view the Picked Chains in different **Contexts**. These are activated by the **Context Button**. Select the Context Button in the right hand toolbar and then click on Above, Between, or Below.

The **Context Above Button** will add all the lines above the Picked Chains to the Filter Screen.

The **Context Between Button** will add the lines in between the lines within the Picked Chains.
