### What is the Search?

**Search** in Rezonator allows you to find specific words or tokens within the discourse, and interact with the search results in useful ways.
  
### Activating the Search Window

To activate the **Search Window**, **Left Mouse Click** on the “Search -> Keyword” option within the “Tools” dropdown.

Another way to activate the Search Window is by pressing the “F” key on the keyboard.

Both of these methods will show the Search Window

### Functionality of the Search Window

The Search Window has 3 main components: the **Text Input Line**, the **Toggle Buttons**, and the **Confirmation Buttons**.

The Text Input Line is where you type in text you want to find in the discourse.

The Toggle Buttons will activate different settings for the current Search

1. **Regular Expression**: When toggled, will allow for searching based on Regular Expression Format.

2. **In Focused Rez Chain**: When toggled, will limit the search space to words within the currently focused Rez Chains.

3. **Case Sensitive**: When toggled, will limit matches to the input text to only those matching the capitalization of the input text.

The Confirmation Buttons allow you to begin the Search, or cancel the Search.

Once the input text is typed and the Search is confirmed, Rezonator will scan through the discourse to find matches. If any matches are found, the search results will be shown on the Search Screen.

### Functionality of the Search Screen

Once matches are found, you will be taken to the Search Screen, which displays all the search results in center alignment.

When a word or token has been marked as a match to the current Search, it will be highlighted in blue, both in the Search Screen and in the Main Screen

In the Search Screen, Lines can be focused by Left Mouse Clicking on the lines. This will show a bold highlight around the Lines in the Search Screen, as well as focus that Line in the Line List.

While in Trail Mode, you can create a **Quick Trail** on the Search results by Left Mouse Dragging along the words.
