2.1 Unit Mode
=====
**Unit Mode** is the default **Mode** of Rezonator, which limits the userâ€™s ability to annotate the data, allowing for safe exploration of the data within the program. Unit Mode also features the **Line List** within the **List Window**. The functionalities of the Unit Mode are described below.

### 2.1.1	Activating Unit Mode

Unit Mode will be active by default when Rezonator is first opened, and this can be seen by the highlighted **Unit Mode Button** in the **Tool Pane**:

When not in Unit Mode, it can be activated by a **Mouse Click** on the Unit Mode Button.

While in Unit Mode, the user is able to navigate through the dialog in multiple ways. The other feature of Unit Mode is its connection to the **Line List**.
